Lab Exercise 1

Invalid Index
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int list[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    //invalid index
    cout << "invalid index[5]: " << list[5];

    return 0;
}

Output:
invalid index[5]: 779647075
When you run the code, it gives a random number because index 5 is out of bounds.
Valid indices are only 0–4. Accessing index 5 reads memory that does not belong to the array.

Modified
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int list[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int index;

    //modified index
    cout << "Enter an index (0-4): ";
    cin >> index;

    if (index >= 0 && index < 5) {
        cout << "Here's the value at index " << index << ": " << list[index];
    } else {
        cout << "Error: invalid index" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Why C++ does not automatically check array bounds
C++ does not check array bounds because:
	It aims to be fast and efficient, especially for system-level programming.
	Automatic bounds checking would slow programs down.
	Developers are given full control (and responsibility) to manage memory.

How can array index errors cause unpredictable results?
	It can access or overwrite other memory.
  It may produce random values.
  It can cause crashes or corrupt data.
	Program behavior becomes unpredictable.

What are good practices to prevent them?
	Always check index ranges before accessing arrays.
	Use loops carefully.
	Use safer structures like std::array or std::vector.
	Test and debug using tools like sanitizers.
